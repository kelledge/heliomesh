# Heliomesh

Heliomesh is a growing collection of PCB designs that enable anyone to build robust solar-power
Meshtastic nodes.

As fun as it is to solder up a solution, these often end up being the weak point of any solution.
This project aims to provide fully integrated solutions that any one can order and pairs nicely
with the existing wide range of Meshtastic devices and enclosures.
